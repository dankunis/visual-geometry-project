## Report

A detailed report about this project can be found [here](./report/report.pdf).


## Getting Started

This project was built and executed with Python 3.7.2 and OpenCV 3.4.2. For the optimal experience please use this version. It might run on other python and OpenCV versions, however we can not garantuee it will.



In order to run the project clone the offical repository on git like:

```bash
git clone https://git.uibk.ac.at/csat8361/visualgeometry.git
```



Navigate into the VisualGeometry/src directory

```bash
cd VisualGeometry/src
```



### Prerequisites

To run the project you need the following python packages:

* numpy

* OpenCV 3.4.2.17

* pyyaml

* tqdm

* matplotlib



All of these packages can be obtained by running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```



Execute the program:

```bash
python3 main.py
```



We provide intermediate results (camera calibration results and keypoint matching) to provide a fast initial run (it takes less than 5 min on MacBook Pro). In order to run all of the steps delete these files:
```bash
rm -rf ../resources/tmp/ ../resources/vid_to_img ../resources/calibration
```
