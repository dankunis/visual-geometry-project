# Visual Geometry - Match-Mover Project

This is the official repo for the Match Mover  Project for 703610 VO/1 VO Visuelle Geometrie 2020


## Getting Started

This project was built and executed with Python 3.7.2 and OpenCV 3.4.2. For the optimal experience please use this version. It might run on other python and OpenCV versions, however we can not garantuee it will.



In order to run the project clone the offical repository on git like:

```bash
git clone https://git.uibk.ac.at/csat8361/visualgeometry.git
```



Navigate into the VisualGeometry/src directory

```bash
cd VisualGeometry/src
```



### Prerequisites

To run the project you need the following python packages:

* numpy

* OpenCV 3.4.2.17

* pyyaml

* tqdm

* matplotlib

  

All of these packages can be obtained by running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```



Execute the program:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

The program can be simply run by not passing any arguments to the main because it will load all previously calibrated files and generate the resulting video. In case you want to recalculate some parameters of the programm
you can pass the following parametrs to main.py. 

**Disclaimer:** Recalculating may take some time (5-10 min) depending on the task.
